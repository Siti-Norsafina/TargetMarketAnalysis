# TargetMarketAnalysis
In this data science project, we will analyze the data of a company to select potential customers and increase the profit of a marketing. The project walks through step by step process of how to build a machine learning model.
During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, 
PCA, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, confusion matrix etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
